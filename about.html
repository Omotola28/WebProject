						Hi, I am social media savvy! Obviously if not I wouldnt be on this job. Just Kidding, my job is to earn you money online.
						Plan strategies and sell products to your customers. Nowadays people are moving into virtual marketing where goods and services
						are most likely purchased online than in store. I am happy to receive emails about queries including queries about 
						what package is best for getting more out of your online presence. You can send a mail to <a href="mailto:omotolashogunle@gmail.com">shoramoore@gmail.com</a>. An interesting fact about me is that my favourite seasonal is The Walking Dead!

						A small idea has grown into a franchise that help people around England to manage their social media platforms more adequately. I am
						proud of the milestone of the work so far and I appreciate the team that has brought the company thus far. I accept invitations to give 
						talks on the impact of social media in our lives and also give an insight on the future of social media. Browse our pages and dont forget 
						to give us feedback or drop in for some specialist advice. I have a 100 items in my bucket list and I am halfway through it, 51 says Travel to 10 countries in 1 month. I would be posting pictures.
