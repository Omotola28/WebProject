							TWITTER CHANGES USER EXPERIENCE; 140-CHARACTER LIMIT UPDATED
						</h2>

								<li>TWITTER</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>
							Twitter is one of my favourite apps to share ideas and read other people’s content and in over a decade using the 140-character limit restriction has not always been a problem but rethinking ways in which one can communicate or reply effectively but still in a fun way has been somewhat daunting. There is great news though twitter announced that the 140-character limit would be more adequate by removing some characters from being counted when tweeting.
						</p>
						<div class="extra">
							<h3>HERE IS WHAT HAS CHANGED</h3>
							<h4>Replying Mentions</h4>
							<p>
								When replying to a tweet or mention the @names will no longer be included in the word count. This will make ongoing conversations more straight forward and easier, no more unnecessary shorthand for words to make sure conversations are relayed to the group effectively.
							</p>
							<h4>Media attachments</h4>
							<p>
								Adding photos, gifts, polls or even quotes will no longer count to the 140-character limit set. Leaving more room to type in tweets
							</p>
							<h4>Retweet and quote your tweets </h4>
							<p>
								Twitter will also be adding functionality that enables you retweet or quote yourself just in case a tweet needs to be re-emphasized, reflected on or wasn’t as popular as it should have been.
							</p>
							<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS UPDATE?</h3>
							<p>
								In my own opinion, I would say it’s a great feature added to the user experience on twitter. Conversations would be easier, faster and more comprehensive. What other ideas do you think twitter should add?  What are your own opinions do you wish they got rid of the character limit entirely?

							<h3>ATTACH THE LINK TO YOUR WEBSITE IN YOUR PROFILE</h3>

							<img src="images/social.png" alt="picture of profile with website link" width="364" height="209">
							<h3>SHARE POST ON MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS </h3>
							<p>
								Social media platforms are now the best tools for spreading content like wildfire. If you have great content and you practice the habit of putting your post on major platforms, it’s inevitable that your content will be redistributed. Though it is always advice able not to post in a way that’s begging for followers, great content should naturally bring traffic to your blog so you can work on creating content that’s relevant to your brand and your readers.
							</p>
							<h3>SCHEDULE TWEETS FOR BLOG POST.</h3>
							<p>
								Automation is your friend when it comes to sharing your blog post. Here we would discuss how to use twitter to schedule tweets for your post. While most content management systems have plugins that allow for automatic tweets of headlines followed by the link to the website while this saves time it can also be easily dismissed and reduce the number if traffic to your website. The more effective practice is to compose strategic tweets and schedule them using tools like <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-schedule-tweets/">Hootsuite</a>. Even though twitter has updated their 140-limit character remember to shorten urls to websites.

							Making money of your blog is not a get rich quick scheme it takes time and effort to do so. Bloggers are making money off their blogs and sharing their income reports and this transparency helps encourage other upcoming bloggers or someone that wants to become a blogger. Monthly reports are where bloggers share their monthly income and Traffic stats generated by their blogs. This is very helpful as it helps a lot of people gain knowledge as to how to monetize their blog. You don’t need millions of readers on your blog before you start cashing out you just have to be strategic and plan which all takes time.

							<h3>HERE ARE FIVE BLOGS WHICH SHARE MONTHLY INCOME OF BLOGGERS</h3>
							<ol class="ls-reports">
								<li>
									CashFlowDiaries.com, the author of this website updates his blog post monthly based on other bloggers monthly reports including himself and outlines their incomes from the highest to the lowest
								</li>
								<li>
									SmartPassiveIncome.com a high earn blogger who has a plugin on his website that shows the general income stats for each month and a round off at the end of the year. He also explains that sharing these stats should be assumed as thinking getting to those numbers is a piece of cake. He shares tips of what has worked for him and what people should implement to their blogs to generate income.
								</li>
								<li>
									Singlemomsincome.com has also been sharing her own reports since 2012 when she started her blog. She highlights how she is self-employed and has to factor money she has made into paying taxes and insurance. All of which takes about 20% of her total income. She also outlines the breakdown of how this income is accumulated and its surprising to see that not all of her income comes from only advertisement as she is also a freelance writer and gets income from writing for other blogs.
								</li>
								<li>
									JustAGirlAndHerBlog.com this is another high income earner for each month. They do a review on their blog each month and in each month highlight what has worked for them and what haven’t worked for them.

								</li>

							WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DOMAIN AUTHORITY(DA) &AMP; HOW TO CHECK IT

							First off let’s define what domain authority is. Domain authority is a score on a 100-point scale that was built by <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority">Moz</a> to predict how well a website will do in search engines. It is important to know this because companies are often interested in your DA score when want to work with you and if in comparison to another website your score is not as high that wouldn’t be good to improve your income stats.
						</p>
						<input type="checkbox" class="read" id="post3"/>
						<div class="extra">
							<blockquote cite="http://xomisse.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-domain-authority/">
								It’s also important to know that Domain Authority is worth measuring against other bloggers or “competitive” sites rather than as a score on it’s own or against your SEO efforts. It builds up very slowly over many years, so don’t feel hard done by if your score isn’t growing. Not even Moz itself have 100/100 DA Score. A DA of 30+ will start showing some authority in search engines.
								Domain Authority is ONLY for custom domains! It does not work for subdomains – such as .blogspot.com or .wordpress.com. If your blog uses one of these, then it’s a subdomain of that platform. The DA score you are getting is for the main domain (blogspot.com or wordpress.com) and does not reflect your blogs score.
							</blockquote>
							<h3>HOW IS DA SCORE CALCULATED?</h3>
							<p>
								Moz score Domain authority based on a 100-point logarithmic scale. Therefore, it is easier to grow your score form 20 – 30 than it is from 70-80. Therefore, what factors affect this score. 
							</p>
							<h3>1.LONGEVITY OF WEBSITE</h3>
							<p>
								The amount of time that a website has been functioning indicated its relevance and concludes that it’s a trusted source of information and not a spam website. The amount of traffic drawn and improvement in the SEO of the website also plays a role.
							</p>
							<h3>2. HOW POPULAR IS YOUR WEBSITE IS?</h3>
							<p>
								Popularity can be measured differently maybe by the number of shares from post or inbound links from other sites to your website just shows that it is a relevant website. Therefore, enhancing the DA score 
							</p>
							<h3>3.SIZE OF WEBSITE</h3>
							<p>
								The size of the website indicates that there is more information and more links on the page to get to.  A larger site with better content will normally have more links that a smaller site.
							</p>
							<h3>4. OTHER</h3>
							<p>
								This could include factors like Moz Rank, Moz Trust, link profile etc. these can impact the score. There is no particular method that is used as there are multiple conditions that are considered before the DA Score is increased.
							</p>
							<h3>HOW TO CHECK YOUR SCORE</h3>
							<p>
								You can go to <a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/">Moz.com</a> and type in your url, only root domain names are calculated as domains with attachments like blogspot.com or WordPress .com are considered subdomains.
